# Where To Go - San Francisco

A group project working with two API's, AJAX, HTML, CSS Framework and JavaScript.

We used the Google Maps, Refuge Restrooms (a gender neutral, accessable API for the San Francisco Area) and PlacesILive API's.

A modal was employed to direct the user to appropriate data entry in the search box. The search must be within the San Francisco region and be selected from the completed addresses generated in the drop down menu.

There is a table that is populated with the search results relevant to the area.

The region for search is restricted to the San Francisco region due to the limitations of the Refuge Restrooms API. PlacesILive provided a safety score for each region searched.

A locator pin is placed on the Google map for the business selected and other indicators are provided for the restroom sites.

Future expansion: 
* may change the appearance of the table
* place the safety score once in prominent display rather than repeating through the table
* expand the search region  -  this is limited by the API's available at the time
